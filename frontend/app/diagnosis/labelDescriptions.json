    "Melanocytic nevi":"What is Melanocytic nevi? \nNevi is the medical term for a mole. Nevi can appear anywhere on the body. They are benign (non-cancerous) and typically do not require treatment. A very small percentage of nevi may develop a melanom within them. Benign nevi are usually a single color, ranging from skin-colored to dark brown, and are typically round or oval-shaped. Additionally, benign moles are symmetric, and are the size of a pencil eraser or smaller. \nGeneral statistics: \n Melanocytic nevi is very common. The malignant transformation rate of the individual nevus is between 0.00005% to 0.003% per year.",
