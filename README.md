SkinLens: AI-Powered Skin Cancer Diagnosis
Introduction
SkinLens is a revolutionary app leveraging Artificial Intelligence to bridge the gap in skin cancer diagnosis and treatment accessibility. With a focus on enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining the consultation process, SkinLens aims to provide timely, affordable, and effective skin health management.

The Problem
In the current healthcare landscape, patients face significant barriers when seeking dermatological advice. The average wait time for an in-person consultation extends up to 34.5 days, and even with insurance, the cost per visit can reach $200. Such hurdles often dissuade individuals from pursuing critical healthcare services, potentially leading to worsening conditions and delayed treatments.

Our Solution
SkinLens utilizes a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify skin lesions into eight distinct types. This AI-driven diagnosis tool not only reduces the dependency on immediate healthcare professional availability but also significantly cuts down the waiting period and costs associated with traditional consultations.

Features
AI Diagnosis: Rapid and reliable identification of skin lesions through a user-friendly mobile interface.
Equitable Access: Facilitates reduced costs and quicker access, promoting regular health check-ups and early detection.
Communication Channels: Seamlessly connects users with skin care clinics for both in-person and virtual consultations.
User Interface: Intuitive and accessible, ensuring ease of use for individuals of all ages and tech-savviness.
How It Works
Users can simply upload a photograph of the skin lesion via the app. The CNN processes the image, classifies the lesion type, and provides an immediate preliminary diagnosis. Following this, users have the option to connect directly with healthcare professionals through the app, where they can schedule in-person or virtual consultations based on the urgency and nature of the condition.
