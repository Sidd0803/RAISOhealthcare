SkinLens is an AI-powered app designed to improve accessibility to skin cancer diagnosis by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify skin lesions. In the current healthcare setting, patients often face long wait times and high costs for dermatological consultations, which can deter them from seeking necessary care. SkinLens addresses these challenges by offering rapid, reliable lesion identification through a user-friendly mobile app, reducing dependence on in-person consultations and associated costs. The app not only facilitates quicker access to skin health management but also provides options for users to connect with healthcare professionals for further consultations, either in-person or virtually. SkinLens aims to enhance patient outcomes by making skin cancer screening more accessible and efficient.
